        <p>While there are a lot of CRM, Tools, and Databases to help developers store their code and information, but unfortunately in the Blockchain Space
            there is not a good solution to store smart contract address, abi's and deployer addresses... Until now!


            Our goal is to simplify storing smart contract information for the smart contracts you develop. As you scale, we scale with you.
